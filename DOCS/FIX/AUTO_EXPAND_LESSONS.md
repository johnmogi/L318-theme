# Auto-Expand Lessons Fix

## Issue
LearnDash course lessons were not automatically expanding on page load, requiring users to manually click "Expand All" to view lesson content.

## Solution
Implemented a robust JavaScript solution that automatically expands all lessons when a course page loads.

### Key Components

1. **Button Detection**
   - Uses multiple selectors to find expand/collapse buttons
   - Checks button state using `aria-expanded` and CSS classes
   - Handles both Hebrew and English button text

2. **Aggressive Expansion**
   - Runs multiple attempts at different intervals
   - Handles dynamically loaded content
   - Force-clicks buttons when needed

3. **Debugging**
   - Detailed console logging
   - Tracks button states before/after clicks
   - Shows which selectors found buttons

### Implementation Details

- **Location**: `functions.php`
- **Trigger**: On course pages (`is_singular('sfwd-courses')`)
- **Dependencies**: jQuery

### Technical Notes

- Uses `jQuery(document).ready()` for proper timing
- Implements multiple fallback selectors
- Handles both static and dynamically loaded content
- Includes error handling and logging

### Testing

1. Clear browser cache
2. Load any course page
3. Verify lessons are expanded automatically
4. Check browser console for debug output

### Debugging

View browser console for detailed logs:
- Button detection status
- Click attempts
- Before/after states
- Any errors

### Future Maintenance

If issues occur, check:
1. Button selectors in console
2. Button states in logs
3. Timing of content loading
4. For dynamic content, ensure selectors still match

ere are the key files and functions involved in the auto-expand solution:

Main Implementation File
/wp-content/themes/hello-theme-child-master/functions.php

Key Functions
add_expand_all_translation_js()
Main function that adds the auto-expand JavaScript
Runs only on course pages (is_singular('sfwd-courses'))
Outputs the JavaScript that handles the auto-expand functionality
forceExpandLessons() (JavaScript)
Core function that finds and clicks expand buttons
Uses multiple selectors to find buttons
Handles both static and dynamic content
enqueue_expand_script()
Ensures jQuery is loaded before our script
Runs early in the WordPress load process
Key Features
Button Detection
javascript
const selectors = [
    '.ld-expand-button',
    '.ld-item-list-actions .ld-expand-button',
    '[data-ld-expand-list="true"] .ld-expand-button',
    'button[data-ld-expand-text]'
];
Expansion Logic
Runs immediately on page load
Additional attempts at 500ms, 1000ms, and 2000ms
Continuous checking every 1500ms (up to 8 attempts)
Debugging
Detailed console logging
Tracks button states
Logs before/after click states
The solution is self-contained in 
functions.php
 and doesn't require any additional files or plugins.
